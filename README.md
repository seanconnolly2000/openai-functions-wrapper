# openai-functions-wrapper

I hope this helps demystify the pipeline for executing multiple requests with OpenAI's chatcompletion.

I've created function wrappers that allow you to create the format necessary for chatcompletion to request function execution and parameters.

I've also illustrated how you need to append your conversation to "messages" to make the chat pipeline and function information work correctly.

Hope this helps you!
